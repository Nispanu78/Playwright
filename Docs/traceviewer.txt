//Traceviewer is a GUI tool that makes the executed tests be viewable along with snapshots, timelines etc. called traces,
// whose function is to trace the execution of the tests.

//To enable traceviewer go to playright.config.js and search for "trace" key

//Example:
trace: 'on-first-retry',

//The code means that the trace become active when the test will be retried for the first time

//In order to tell playwright to retry the test another time if it fails, in playright.config.js comment out the following line of code

  //retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,

//under
/* Retry on CI only */

//Then add
//retries:1,


//To decrease the time that playwright will wait before failing the test, go to the following section of playright.config.js and add the following key:value playright
//timeout:5

//Example:

module.exports = defineConfig({
  timeout:5*1000 
  testDir: './tests',


//To open traceviewer:

1. Go to the report, scroll to the bottom where subsection called "Traces" is present and click on the picture of the trace
2. Download the zip file containing the trace by clicking on it
2a. For opening the trace from the command line use:
npx playwright show-trace test-results/first_failed_test_to_learn_tracing-test-chromium-retry1/trace.zip
3. Go to the browser and enter trace.playwright.dev and upload the zip file to it


//To configure traceviewer, go to playright.config.js and keeping right-CTRL pressed, click on "trace". Options are the following:

   * - `'off'`: Do not record trace.
   * - `'on'`: Record trace for each test. (this will record a trace whether the test passes or fails)
   * - `'on-first-retry'`: Record trace only when retrying a test for the first time.
   * - `'on-all-retries'`: Record trace only when retrying a test.
   * - `'retain-on-failure'`: Record trace for each test. When test run passes, remove the recorded trace.
   * - `'retain-on-first-failure'`: Record trace for the first run of each test, but not for retries. When test run
   *   passes, remove the recorded trace.
