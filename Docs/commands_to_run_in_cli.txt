//  Commands from command line

    //To run the test: npx playwright test
    //This command will run all tests in the "tests" folders and in all browsers
    
    //npx playwright test --workers 3 (this command will assign 3 workers/individual test session/specific test files and make them run in parallel)


    //To run a specific test when there is more than one the command is: 
    //npx playwright test + copy relative path from the IDE and past it in the CLI but change backslash into slash
    //Example:
    //npx playwright test tests/firstTest.spec.ts
    

    //To run multiple spec files in one shot use: 
    //npx playwright test firstTest.spec.ts thirdTest.spec.ts


    //To run test files giving just some elements of the file mame, not the whole file name use:
    //npx playwright test firstTest thirdTest


    //To run the test giving the name of the function instead of the name of the file use:
    //npx playwright test -g 'My second test'

    //To run all tests that use a specific browser, use:
    //npx playwright test --project=chromium

    //To run the test in headed mode use:
    //npx playwright test --headed

    //To run tests in debug mode use:
    //npx playwright test --project=chromium --debug

    //To combine different modes to run the files use:
    //npx playwright test thirdTest.spec.ts --project=chromium --headed

    //To set tracevalues from the command line
    // To turn on the trace for all the test use:
    npx playwright test --trace on 
    // To turn off the trace for all the test use:
    npx playwright test --trace off
    // The same applies to all the possible configurations trace may have as shown in the configuration file
