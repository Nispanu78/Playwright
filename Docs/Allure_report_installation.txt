//To install Allure report:

npm i -D allure-playwright

npm i -D allure-commandline

//To get the allure report run:

npx allure generate .\allure-results\ --clean

//It seems that allure is not working for me because JAVA is not installed. When giving the command: allure serve C:\Users\menhi\Desktop\Files Nicola\IT Resources\Testing-Continuous integration\Playwright\allure-results

//I get:

ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.

Please set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the
